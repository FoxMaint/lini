# Releasing

Several repositories ship as one product, and they are not independent:

```
lini              the compiler and the language        crates.io
  ├─ lini-wasm    the same compiler, for JavaScript    npm
  │    └─ remark-lini   ```lini fences, for remark     npm
  │         └─ astro-lini   the Astro integration      npm
  ├─ mdbook-lini  links lini as a library              crates.io
  └─ lini-website   lini.rs — builds against the rest  deployed
```

The indentation is the publish order, and for the npm chain it is a hard one:
`remark-lini` pins `lini-wasm` and `astro-lini` pins `remark-lini`, so a package
published before the one above it installs nothing.

The site also builds against a book theme checked out beside these.

`lini-website` builds the book with **the sibling checkouts**, never with what
crates.io last published, so a fix landed this morning is on the site this
afternoon. That is the whole reason the order below matters, and the source of
the one trap worth knowing.

## The order

1. **lini** — bump, tag, publish, write the release note. The bump lands in
   `Cargo.toml` *and* `crates/lini-wasm/Cargo.toml`; `cargo xtask wasm` refuses
   to build if the two disagree.
2. **lini-wasm** — `cargo xtask wasm`, then `npm publish` from
   `crates/lini-wasm/pkg`. Its version is read out of the workspace manifest,
   so there is nothing to bump here.
3. **remark-lini** — bump its `lini-wasm` floor if the JS surface moved, then
   publish. Its CI installs from the registry, so it stays red until step 2
   lands.
4. **astro-lini** — bump its `remark-lini` floor, publish. It carries no
   compiler of its own: the fence, the figure and the stylesheet all come from
   `remark-lini`, and `astro-lini.css` is copied from it at build time.
5. **mdbook-lini** — `cargo update -p lini`, bump, publish. Its `lini = "1.x"`
   picks up the new compiler on the way past.
6. **lini.rs** — `./deploy.sh --prod`.

`mdbook-lini` before `lini` also works, since a caret dependency resolves to
the newest patch at install time. Doing it after means nobody installs the
preprocessor in the window where it would pull the older compiler.

## The trap: a patch that is quietly declined

`deploy.sh` builds the preprocessor with the sibling compiler patched in:

```sh
cargo build --release --manifest-path "$MDBOOK_LINI/Cargo.toml" \
  --config "patch.crates-io.lini.path=\"$LINI_REPO\""
```

**Cargo refuses a patch whose version does not match the lockfile, and says so
in a warning.** Bumping lini to a new version is exactly what breaks the match:
`mdbook-lini/Cargo.lock` still pins the old one, the patch is dropped, and the
book is built by whatever crates.io last published — silently, because a
warning is not a failure.

This has already shipped a page of stale figures and one red error box to
production. Two guards now stand in the way, both in `deploy.sh`:

- the preprocessor step greps its own output for `was not used in the crate
  graph` and stops, naming the fix;
- the site step stops on any `mdbook-lini:` error **or** warning, because a
  figure that fails to draw becomes a visible error box rather than a failed
  build — the right call while writing, the wrong one before a deploy.

The fix, when the first guard fires:

```sh
(cd ../mdbook-lini && cargo update -p lini)
```

Commit that lockfile. It is what `cargo install --locked` will use, so a stale
one hands people the wrong compiler too.

## Before publishing anything

**Bumping the version breaks `cargo test` until you regenerate the schema.**
`schema/lini.schema.json` and `schema/reference.md` are built from the ledger
and carry the version, and two tests compare them byte for byte:

```sh
cargo xtask gen-schema      # after every version bump, before the commit
```

Both `Cargo.toml` and `crates/lini-wasm/Cargo.toml` carry the version, and the
wasm xtask refuses to build if they disagree.

```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --all-targets
cargo test
cargo publish --dry-run
```

And sweep for links that a rename just broke — a chapter's URL comes from its
`##` heading in `SPEC.md`, so renaming a section moves a published page:

```sh
grep -rn "docs/reference/" README.md SKILL.md ../mdbook-lini/README.md
```

A README on crates.io is immutable once published. A dead link there outlives
the mistake by a version.

## The release note

`gh release create vX.Y.Z --title "Lini X.Y.Z" --notes-file …`, following the
shape 1.0.0 set: what it is, `cargo install lini`, then a **`### Since`**
section of one bullet per change — what it does for a reader, not what the
commit touched. Link the spec section a fix belongs to.

There is no `CHANGELOG.md`. The releases page is the changelog, and `git log`
is the detail under it.
